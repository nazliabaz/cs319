# Project Description
Our project is a game that is inspired by Flappy Bird developed by Dong Nguyen.
However, our game will be a PC game rather than an android game. Also, rather than controlling
the bird via keyboard or mouse, the bird will move through a straight line with a steady velocity.
The user will have to solve the mathematical questions written on the columns to open a path for
the bird to move through the game. The upper half of a column will go upside if the answer is
correct. If the columns are closed when the bird reaches them, the game ends. After the
mathematical questions will get harder for every five columns the bird passes through.
