# Project Description
Break It! is a fun and entertaining game that any person of any age can easily play. The game will be developed with Java. The main purpose of the game is to move the bird through columns and enemies to safely reach its nest. Even though, it may seem similar to other popular games, Break It! combines lots of different features to make it more fun and a challenging experience for the player. 
The player will move the bird forward and backwards to escape the enemy and shoots the columns to create a pathway to move forward. Passing each column will enable the player to play the next level. The game will be a desktop application and will be controlled with the keyboard.
